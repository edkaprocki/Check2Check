Check 2 Check - Things to do
----------------------------
Where is the notes.text saved to the proper array element?
What about all the undo notes and do I need an undo misc notes?

I have been using the trial version of this program and it is a great one. The next version, if you have time, I really like to see a few options such as year-to-date for expense or deposit, grand expense and deposit totals for one file, and quick fill for the "name" column.

Source code to write direct to the desktop in VB3:


Open Visual Basic, Form1 created as default.
Put a PictureBox on the form.
Make sure it is called Picture1.
Put a bitmap in the PictureBox.
In Form_Load , put the following.
	
	
	Dim ImgWidth as Integer
	Dim ImgHeight as Integer
	DIM ImgX%, ImgY%, Dmy%

    	ImgWidth = Picture1.ScaleWidth
    	ImgHeight = Picture1.ScaleHeight
	
	ImgX% = 0  
	ImgY% = 0

    	hwndSrc% = 0
    	hSrcDC% = GetDC(hwndSrc%)      'same as GetDc(Null)
    	res% = BitBlt(hSrcDC%, ImgX%, ImgY%, ImgWidth, ImgHeight, Picture1.hDC, 0, 0, SRCCOPY)
    	Dmy% = ReleaseDC(hwndSrc%, hSrcDC%)  ' IMPORTANT release resources back to windows



In Declarations section of Form1 put the following Declares.

Declare Function GetDC Lib "User" (ByVal hWnd%) As Integer
Declare Function BitBlt Lib "GDI" (ByVal hDestDC%, ByVal x%, ByVal y%, ByVal nWidth%, ByVal nHeight%, ByVal hSrcDC%, ByVal XSrc%, ByVal YSrc%, ByVal dwRop&) As Integer
Declare Function ReleaseDC Lib "User" (ByVal hWnd As Integer, ByVal hDC As Integer) As Integer
Const SRCCOPY = &HCC0020 


Ok.
Click on Run,  What happens ? 
Your PictureBox is copied to the desktop at the values ImgX%, ImgY%.
In this case that is 0,0 or the topleft corner of the Desktop.
Your image is not there permanently however, as soon as the Desktop is
refreshed it will disappear.
If you want it to persist, you will have to keep putting the image back.

While the Package & Deployment Wizard (PDW) works just fine on Windows XP, you may encounter some errors when you try to install an XP-packaged app on an earlier OS, such as Windows 98. When you try to use the installation program, it may generate an error that says some of the files are out of date. It then asks to update the files. If you agree to update the files, Windows 98 reboots and generates the following error:

The MSVCRT.DLL file is linked to missing export NTDLL.DLL RtlGetNtVersionNumbers

To say the least, this behavior can cause extreme difficulty for end-users, especially if they don't have their OS backup disks handy. Fortunately, there's a workaround.

Apparently, this problem occurs because the XP version of the PDW uses its own version of MSVCRT.DLL. It then tries to copy this DLL to the target machine. However, this DLL is incompatible with Windows 98 and will crash the system. To avoid this troublesome behavior, copy MSVCRT.DLL from the OS\System folder of the Visual Studio 6.0 CD to the \Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\VB98\Wizards\PDWizard\Redist folder on the XP machine.
