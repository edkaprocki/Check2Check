

"Characters Left"         This refers to the number of character on the screen that can be typed into the Misc Notes window
"Caracteres dejados"
 
"Next Month Top"        Go to the beginning of next month
"Tapa siguiente del mes"
 
"Previous Month Bottom"        Go to the end of the previous month
"fondo anterior del mes"

"Monthly Notes"      This was just called Notes before but I changed it to Monthly notes to distinguish it from Misc Notes
"Notas Mensuales"
 
"Misc Notes"         I thought about calling it General Notes. If you have any suggestions let me know
"Notas Variadas"
 
"Insert Last Name"
"Nombre Actual"
 
"Last Ref Number"
"Número Actual"
 
"New Ref Number"
"Número Nuevo"

"Spanish"
"Espanole"
